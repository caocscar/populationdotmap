# Population Dot Map
Python port of a racial dot map done in Processing forked from
[https://github.com/unorthodox123/RacialDotMap] (https://github.com/unorthodox123/RacialDotMap)

Run *dotmap.py* to create the png tiles. It uses a Vermont population file as an example.

*dotmap_flatten.py* is a MPI friendlier version of *dotmap.py*.

*globalmaptiles.py* has been modified from fork to work with *dotmap.py* and to make functions more understandable and explicit.
